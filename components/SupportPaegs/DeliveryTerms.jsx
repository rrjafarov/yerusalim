            Our candles stand apart from other candles or candle companies for a
            few reasons, but the main one being our ingredients. Compared to our
            candles, the standard candle has a multitude of differences, one
            being the wax itself.  There is a common misconception that all
            candles are made from the same kind of wax, but that is false.
            <br /> <br /> The wax used to make candles differs from the candle
            company youre purchasing from, as well as the companys beliefs and
            commitment to the consumer.  We pride ourselves on using
            American-grown soybeans. Using soy wax is the most ethically
            responsible choice as soy wax is derived from a natural vegetable
            wax—AKA soybeans. Soybeans are, of course, all-natural, as opposed
            to paraffin wax which is the more common alternative candle wax. {" "}
            <br /> <br />
            Our luxury candles are so great because you can always count on them
            to last longer, burn more evenly, and keep your home perfectly
            scented—not too overpowering, but still giving you plenty of
            fragrance to appreciate.
